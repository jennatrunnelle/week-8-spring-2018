For this assignment I was only able to find one vulnerability under the Red site. 
At first I tried clicking on find a salesperson on the green site and changed the id number in the website URL.
It didn't work on the green site, but then it worked on the red  site. When I changed the id to 10 and 11 users
popped up who were not shown before. This is an IDOR vulnerability on the public's side.


# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumerat
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: ___________n/a_______
  
Vulnerability #2: __________n/a________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: _____n/a_____________

Vulnerability #2: ______n/a____________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: ___IDOR_______________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

Since there werent many hints I didn't really know what I was looking for. Couldnt find that many vulnerabilites. Needed better instructions.
